FROG (Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating) Software
=================================================

This is the software program developed by Dr. Kenneth DeLong in the early 1990's at Sandia National Laboratories for using the FROG technique to measure ultrafast laser pulses.  This repository contains the last existing development version (3.2.5-dev) of the program sold by the now-defunct Femtosoft Technologies, LLC.

The program is a Delphi program which (as of this writing) is available from Embarcadero.

Femtosoft has closed its doors, but I thought it was something of a crime if the code remained locked away on my hard disk.  If you enjoy it I'm always happy to receive a donation!  :-)  I give this as a gift to the scientific community!
